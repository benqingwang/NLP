Fine-tuning an NLP model like all-mpnet-base-v2 (which is based on the MPNet architecture and is designed for embedding generation useful in semantic search) to better handle specific tasks like understanding nuances in regulatory reporting can significantly improve its performance, especially in reducing false negatives. Here's how you can approach fine-tuning this model for your specific needs:

1. Gather and Prepare Training Data
To fine-tune a model, you need a dataset that represents the task well. For your case, you should gather examples of sentences and phrases from the domain of regulatory reporting. You need:

Positive examples that should match queries (like "FR Y9C will be refiled").
Negative examples that should not match but are closely related.
Label this data accordingly (e.g., 0 for non-match and 1 for match).
2. Choose a Fine-tuning Strategy
There are two main approaches you could take for fine-tuning:

Sentence Pair Classification: Create pairs of query sentences and document sentences, labeling them as relevant (1) or not relevant (0). Train the model to classify these pairs correctly.
Triplet Loss: Use an approach where the model learns directly from a triplet consisting of a query, a positive sentence, and a negative sentence. The goal is to make the positive sentence closer to the query than the negative sentence in the embedding space.
3. Modify the Model for Fine-Tuning
You'll likely use a framework like Hugging Face’s Transformers. You might need to add a classification layer on top of all-mpnet-base-v2 if you're doing sentence pair classification, or adjust the model to output embeddings directly for use with triplet loss.

4. Set Up Your Training Environment
Use a machine learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow. Here’s a basic setup using PyTorch and Hugging Face’s Transformers:
"""
#====================================================================================
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer, AdamW

# Load tokenizer and model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2")

# Assuming you have a DataLoader setup for your training data
# Here is a simple optimizer setup
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    for batch in dataloader:
        inputs = tokenizer(batch['sentences'], return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True)
        outputs = model(**inputs)
        # Compute loss function here, for example, cross-entropy or triplet loss
        loss = loss_fn(outputs, batch['labels'])
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()

#====================================================================================

"""
5. Train and Evaluate the Model
Training: Train the model on your annotated dataset. Monitor the loss and validation metrics to adjust hyperparameters if needed.
Evaluation: Test the model on a held-out set or through cross-validation. Look specifically for improvements in areas where the model previously generated false negatives.
6. Deploy the Fine-Tuned Model
Once fine-tuned and evaluated, integrate the model into your application. Monitor its performance in production and collect feedback for potential further improvements.

Fine-tuning models like all-mpnet-base-v2 requires careful attention to the training data and the loss functions used. The key to success will be how well your 
training data represents the diversity and complexity of the language used in regulatory reporting contexts. Also, consider using or customizing existing sentence 
transformers or similar architectures specifically tailored for semantic similarity and relevance tasks.
